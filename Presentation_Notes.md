- Scientific data:
Wait Times
  - Commuters wait on average 11 min, but over 32% wait longer than 20 minutes.
Walk Distance
  - Approximately, 22% of the people walk more than 1 km to reach their destination.
Transfers
  - On average, 30% of riders transfer at least twice during a single trip.

  - Average commute distance is ~9 km. 59% of riders travel over 12 km in a single direction.

- Demo Scenarios
  - Bus - car crash
  - Andy is in the bus, Andy sends a broadcast message about the crash
  - Julie is at home, about to go to her meeting at work

  - Katrin got information from different sources including Andy

- Presentation of the application after/during role play


Final thoughts:

- Tech stack, background of n-matrix, IBM support
- A trans-disciplinary team looking to solve the same problems
- Objective to simulate traffic flows using real time data, swarm intelligence
- Focus on ease of use and positively influencing user behaviour
- Historical data analysis and IoT inputs as available extensions
- A sufficiently good solution to an optimisation problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity


- Should this be fully automated? Is this a technological domain problem? **Economics!**
- End decision is a **human's decision** albeit software assisted. **Human!**

- Groups do not need to be dominated by exceptionally intelligent people in order to be smart. Even if most of the people within a group are note specially well-informed or rational, it can still reach a collectively wise decision

- Emotional design: Don Norman.
- 'Attractive products trigger our creativity and ultimately expand our mental processes, making us more tolerant of minor difficulties. What he is saying is that attractive products make problem-solving easier, which makes them absolutely essential. Emotional Design is Norman’s reaction to critics who said that if they followed his rules, their designs would be only functional but ugly.' - Not Just Pretty: Building Emotion Into Your Websites, Sabina Idler, 2012
